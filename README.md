# IBM_Employee_Attrition

****<ins>Introduction</ins>****

SQL is used in managing and querying a database. Understanding employee attrition is a critical aspect in the workforce. I embarked on an analysis of employee attrition dataset which contains a variety of factors that may contribute to employee attrition.

***I used MYSQL in this project to query and extract results from the dataset provided. I Used the ***<ins>train</ins>*** dataset provided of the two given in the Ibm Employee Attrition. 

The data was clean and the needed transformation was changing the Dataset name using excel (I was using this data for learning purposes).
I uploaded the dataset as a csv file in MYSQl using the data import wizard.
